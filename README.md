# Game Jam Project Report: *The Collapse of Civilization*

## Introduction
Our participation in the recent "Game Jam" led us to develop a project titled *The Collapse of Civilization*. The project initially aimed to combine 2D and 3D elements in a dynamic environment featuring four unique characters, intricate puzzles, and interactive NPC dialogues. While our goal was ambitious, our limited knowledge of game development presented unforeseen challenges. However, we were ultimately able to submit a scaled-down version of the game, which consisted of a 2D character moving in a 3D environment that emitted a beeping sound upon collision with objects.

## Initial Goals and Vision
Our primary objective was to create a comprehensive game with the following key elements:
- **2D/3D Integration:** A blend of 2D character sprites interacting with a 3D world for enhanced visual depth.
- **Character Abilities:** A range of abilities, including phasing mechanics, to solve environmental puzzles.
- **Narrative and NPC Interactions:** Engaging story-driven gameplay with meaningful NPC dialogue.
- **Mission-Based Structure:** Progressive stages starting with a tutorial and discovery phase, eventually expanding into village exploration.

## Challenges Faced
Unfortunately, our lack of prior experience with game development limited our ability to fully realize these goals. As newcomers to both Unity and Unreal Engine, we underestimated the technical challenges involved in implementing complex mechanics, detailed animations, and interactive dialogue systems within the given time frame. 

Despite our initial setbacks, we successfully created a working demo featuring:
- A 2D character capable of moving in a 3D environment.
- A basic collision detection system that triggers a beeping sound when the player interacts with objects.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout the project, our team gained a valuable understanding of both Unity and Unreal Engine. While we initially experimented with Unity, we ultimately decided to build the final submission using Unreal Engine due to its robust environment design tools and streamlined workflow.

Our experience provided insights into:
- **Character Animation:** Implementing sprite sheets, motion control, and collision detection.
- **Environment Design:** Understanding level layout and integrating 3D assets.
- **Scripting and Game Logic:** Developing core game mechanics using Unreal Engine's Blueprints system.

## Team Contributions
Our team's dedication ensured significant progress in various aspects of the project. The individual contributions are as follows:
- **Anand:** Script development and environment design.
- **Ashwin:** Background assets and environment creation.
- **Kestelyn:** NPC character design and dialogue writing.
- **Rohan:** Character design and motion implementation.

## Conclusion
While we were unable to deliver the complete vision we set out to achieve, our participation in the "Game Jam" was an invaluable learning experience. Moving forward, we aim to build upon the knowledge gained, refine our skills, and expand our understanding of game development to create more advanced projects in the future.

Our journey reflects our growth as developers, and we are proud of the progress made despite the challenges faced. We look forward to future opportunities to apply these lessons and deliver an improved version of *The Collapse of Civilization*.
